The dream continues to haunt me old friend. It always starts with a
journey to a distant land. There I find a city in flames.

Streets choked with corpses. Unthinkable destruction.
I witness senseless slaughter. Brother against brother.

Pure hatred. And then, executions. And then suffering surrounded me
until my turn comes. It burned my eyes. Break my bones. I wake in terror.

There's no-one left to stand against them. You think me mad, old friend.
But I know these dreams. They tell of the future.

Hell is coming, brother.'''
